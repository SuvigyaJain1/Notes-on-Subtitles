## What are subtitles ?
**Subtitles** are the text you probably have seen on your screens (TV, mobiles, etc) which display the dialgoue on screen or other information related to the video content being played. They were originally created to help those hard of hearing but have also found use in making content accessible to more people across language barriers and just as a means to add translations. **Closed captioning** refers to the same thing as subtitles. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtitles]

These subtitles, subs for short can be pre-rendered with the video, or be separate as
- Graphic (.png for example) 
- Text

The separate ones have the obvious advantage of being hidden until the user explicitly turns them on, as well as easy editing. But they also additionaly require 'markers' to give information about where to place the subtitles in the video. These markers are typically timecodes although they can be the length of the film as well.
